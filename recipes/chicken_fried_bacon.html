        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken fried bacon is breaded with seasoned flour and deep-fried until golden and crispy. Serve it with ranch dressing for dipping.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>â…“ cup ranch dressing, plus more for dipping, if desired</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot chile paste</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>24 (1-inch) pieces red onion</li>
            <li>12 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>12 (6-inch) bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 2 hours</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack inside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Meanwhile, cut bacon in half crosswise and season evenly on both sides with multi-purpose seasoning.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a shallow bowl. Alternatively, season flour with additional multi-purpose seasoning blend. Whisk eggs, beer, and syrup together in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Coat each piece of bacon lightly in seasoned flour. Then coat in egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. Coat once more in flour mixture; set aside until all pieces are coated and oil is hot.</li>
            <li>Working a few pieces at a time, fry each piece in hot oil, flipping occasionally, until crispy golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Maintain the oil temperature between 330 and 350 degrees F (165 to 175 degrees C) while cooking. Drain bacon on the prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining bacon.</li>
            <li>Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
